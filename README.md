Project 1 :   Personal Cybersecurity Audit and Remediation Plan
i took the initiative to ensure that my personal devices, network and data are well protected 

1) i started off by doing a vulnerability scan to check what vulnerabilities all of my devices had 
2)i noted down all of the vulnerabilities that came up
3)i created a step by step remediation plan to secure my devices 
4)which included all the protocols i took to ensure the safety and security of my personal devices and Data

Project 2 : Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework Development
Project Description: Enhancing Cybersecurity in the Finance and Banking Sector

As a cybersecurity professional, Iâ€™ve developed a comprehensive risk management framework tailored to the unique challenges faced by international financial institutions. 
This framework aligns with the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) domains, ensuring robust protection for critical assets.

Project 3: Setting Up a Secure Home Network
Jun 2024 - Jun 2024
Secured My Home Network: A Practical Approach (Project 3)

In this project, I designed and implemented a secure and efficient home network to enable safe communication between devices and the internet.

Key Achievements:
Established a solid understanding of core networking concepts (LANs, WANs, modems, routers, switches) and cybersecurity best practices.
Planned and configured a home network, optimizing device connectivity (wired and wireless) and router placement for maximum coverage.
Secured the network through:
Implementing WPA2/WPA3 encryption with a strong password.
Customizing the network name (SSID) for better privacy.
Enabling the router's firewall.
Ensured device security by:
Updating software and security patches on all devices.
Installing antivirus software on computers.
Implementing strong, unique passwords and regular password changes.
Established network monitoring practices to identify suspicious activity.
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in securing a home network, promoting safe and reliable internet access for all connected devices.


Project 4 : Security Vulnerabulity Assessment report 

Unveiled: Zero-Day Threats in Google Chrome (Project 4)

Sharpened my vulnerability assessment skills by dissecting critical security flaws (CVE-2024-5274 & CVE-2024-4761) within Google Chrome.

The Challenge: Identify and analyze high-risk vulnerabilities in a widely used browser.

My Approach :

Conducted a comprehensive security assessment, leveraging my understanding of CVE designations and exploitation methods.
Analyzed two zero-day exploits:
CVE-2024-5274: This critical flaw allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code and potentially steal user data or compromise browser functionality.
CVE-2024-4761: This exploit targeted Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling attackers to bypass security sandboxes and gain unauthorized system access.
Deep-dived into real-world exploitation scenarios to understand the potential impact.

The Impact:

Demonstrated proficiency in vulnerability assessment methodologies.
Provided mitigation strategies, including browser updates, enhanced security settings, and secure coding practices.
Highlighted the importance of proactive security measures to combat evolving cyber threats.

Project 5 - SME Security Blueprint Design 

SME Security Blueprint Design

Developed a comprehensive security blueprint to mitigate cyber and physical risks for a small manufacturing company (25 employees) in the West Midlands, UK.

Reduced the attack surface by designing a physical layout with separated and secured zones (showroom vs. workshop) and access control points.
Implemented keycard access control to restrict unauthorized entry to sensitive areas.
Secured critical assets such as customer data and financial information by mitigating vulnerabilities like weak passwords and outdated software.
Established security protocols to address physical threats like theft, fire, and natural disasters.
This project demonstrates my ability to:

Conduct thorough security risk assessments to identify threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts.
Design and implement security solutions that address both cyber and physical security needs.
Create security blueprints that are tailored to the specific needs of a small business.
