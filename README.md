Secured My Home Network: A Practical Approach (Project 3)

In this project, I designed and implemented a secure and efficient home network to enable safe communication between devices and the internet.

Key Achievements:
Established a solid understanding of core networking concepts (LANs, WANs, modems, routers, switches) and cybersecurity best practices.
Planned and configured a home network, optimizing device connectivity (wired and wireless) and router placement for maximum coverage.
Secured the network through:
Implementing WPA2/WPA3 encryption with a strong password.
Customizing the network name (SSID) for better privacy.
Enabling the router's firewall.
Ensured device security by:
Updating software and security patches on all devices.
Installing antivirus software on computers.
Implementing strong, unique passwords and regular password changes.
Established network monitoring practices to identify suspicious activity.
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in securing a home network, promoting safe and reliable internet access for all connected devices.
